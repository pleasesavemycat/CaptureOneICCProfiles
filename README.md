# CaptureOneICCProfiles
A series of ICC profiles for use with Capture One that I have created using [DCamProf](https://www.ludd.ltu.se/~torger/dcamprof.html).

# Installation
**MacOS**

Copy the ICC profile to: `/Users/<username>/Library/Colorsync/Profiles.`

**Windows**

Copy the profile to: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\CaptureOne\Color Profiles.`

After copying the ICC profile(s), Capture One must be restarted to load in the new profiles.

# Usage
The new profiles will are found in the `Other` section of the `ICC Profile` dropdown box. Just select the profile and it will be applied to the image.
